# Northcoders News API

The purpose of this API is to access application data programmatically. This is mimicing the building of a real world backend service (similar to reddit).

To set up the database correctly you'll need the following commands:

npm run...
setup-dbs - to set up the database
seed - to seed the database
test - to run the testing suite
prepare - to install Husky

To ensure the databse is kept secure, two .env files will need to be set up with the database name. These files are git ignored, to ensure the safety of the database.
